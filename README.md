# XMR-Windows

One click XMR miner for windows. It is very annoying for the antivirus prompt when using Xmrig in windows. In addition to the windows default protection or defender, contributing to decentralized network with xmrig is almost impossible for machines that are "useless" with stupid settings e.g., office one. There is a functionality to minimize the program with "PIN".

To simplify things or setup, just

1. download / usb ( Do once / first time )
2. copy & paste address ( Do once / first time )
3. click start


## Features

* Work with no adminstrator right
* Anti-virus can be enabled
* No false positive for Windows protection / defender
